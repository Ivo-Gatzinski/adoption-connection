# Adoption-Connection
## Description
Adoption Connection is based on the idea to quickly find dogs that are up for adoption within a certain area. Our motivations stem from one our team mate's, Ivo, mother wants to adopt a dog but does not know where to start. Our solution is our app. It starts with a simple search for zipcode and then type of breed the user is looking for. This will being the user to the next page with results showing dogs within the parameters. If the user likes a certain dog, they then can click on the dog which brings them to their profile for a closer look.

## Installation
As a team we started with a wireframe, laying out what will happen at each page and what functions need to happen to achieve this. We split up the app work by sections.
    Ryan - HTM L& CSS for homepage and profile page
    Jesse - HTML & CSS for search results page
    Ivo - Javascript and petfinder API
    Justin- Google maps Intergration

Spliting the work in this fashion gave us a few blockers because if the html is not done on a certain page, then other team mates were not able to start or continue their work. Another issue we had was Wireframing. We did not achieve specifics on the wireframing the first time doing it. This resulted in difficulty with placement. 

We also used Kanban to help visualize new issues with the app

Github was new for everone in the group as well; figuring  out how to create branches and merge within a group.
